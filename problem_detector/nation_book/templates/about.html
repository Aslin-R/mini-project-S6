   <h1> Welcome to Problem Solver,</h1> A <b>non-profit social organization </b> dedicated to <b>solving some of the most pressing and unsolvable problems in society and the nation</b>. Our mission is to help bridge the gap between people, governments, and organizations by <b>collecting ideas</b> and <b>generating solutions</b> that benefit everyone.

    <h2>Our Target :</h2>
    We believe that everyone has a role to play in finding solutions to the challenges facing our society and nation. That's why we created Problem Solver - a platform where anyone can post a problem, and anyone can contribute ideas to help solve it. Using machine learning techniques, we analyze these ideas to generate solutions that we highlight to leaders, governments, and other higher officials.
